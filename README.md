Hello, this is Ren. 

1. I am a software engineer, improving the query understanding for Google search ranking with machine learning. Ranging from small decision trees to large language models.  
2. I love carpentry and woodworking and am the executive assistant to my wife on gardening and landscaping in our one-acre suburb home. 
3. I have two smart but complex ADHD kiddos and three lovely cats.
